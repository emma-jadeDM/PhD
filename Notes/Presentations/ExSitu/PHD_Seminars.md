# Expressive Glyph-based Data Visualisations - Vincent Bonczak (10/06/2025)

Expressive Languages for Creative Data Viz Authoring (PhD title) / interactive creation of sketch-based data vizs

Expressivity of diff tools VS quick graphics (e.g. excel) 
Cos of learning how to program VS tedious to custom
Coding to create visuals 
Structured chart-creation tools VS drawing tools 
§ drawing tool =/=data → to finish so purely aesthetics 
§ common interests 

Glyph-based : putting data in the glyphs / non-sstandard / personal style variations 
£ Nature is glyph-based (flowers hold information) 

Visualisation grammars 
code (Atlas/MSC) VS descriptive (Vega-Lite) VS lazy data-binding (graphics→data)
Deformation is not supported (gap)
£ table of what is supported and what isn't as a theorical contribution of digesting the litterature + help argue that one wish to fill this gap 

# Designing with web technologies in graphic design: an instrumental and anthropocentric point of view - Julie Blanc (27/05/2025) 

Phd → Impact of code on GD practices, how it contributes to dvp of community of practices
Activity theory / Activity of composition
	Editorial design = composition : manual assembly + combining elements to create something new 
1) Intw 2) Case Studies 3) Hackaton 

### Conceptual framework
Cultural historical theory of activity (Egenström) 
Instrument mediated activity approach (Rabardel) → More in french ergonomics
	Philosophycal / cross disciplinary frame work 
	Situated, object oriented, mediated by one or more instruments or tools
	→ Humans are studies in a context, u cant understand w/o context = situated
	→ Object = different objects, needs
Artifacts, objects, systems → Not just technical aspects ! 
	"A tool is waht it is used for" 'Bannon & Bodker 1991)
	"Tools shape the way human beings interact with reality / shaping of external activities results in the shaping of internal ones" (Kaptellini & Nardi 2006)
Historical Development of Activities ! (From late typesetting to code)

Instruments mediate activity of subject with object or other subject
Instrument : physical or symbolic artefacts combined with utilization schemes (instrument can't be reduced to the artifact)
cf. Action Schemes
Instrument takes shape through use

Instrumental Genesis : mutual evolution of the instrument and the project !
Artefact                                      Subject
	     Instrumentation → 
	     ← Instrumentalization 
	
### Itw
Situated description of the activity of composition
Why use this or that tool
Set of core instruments (grids, baselines, templates, page flow…) 
Transformation of editorial workflow with web technologies
Values and practices of free software culture
#### Video and code based study
→ Describe in more details the transformation of composition activity with use of web technologies
	Close analysis in an ecological situation : screen record during working process + self confrontation itw + analyse of the source code 
#### Results :

→ Generic composition instruments
→ HTML/CSS to describe a generic layout / template as an instrument 

Amélie : itération/ bottom up (a page to generic)
Benjamin : entonnoir/ top down (global rules to specific rafinement) 
→ From the same artefact (HTML/CSS) we observe diff schemes of utilization leading to different instruments (template)
Instruments reflect practices and individual experience 

§ descriptive at first → design phase, implementation phase (copy/past), adjustment phase (common structure but variations)
§ i think it's interesting to really look at how it happened, with precise data (not just a story) but it sounds very time consuming. How did Julie process the data ? It's "only" two cases and not rooted in user experience and feelings… 
Creating instruments with other people's code 
Benjamin → two tone filter for images
Creatong a condensed narrative and then showing it to the participant so that they comment 
Using documentation to understand how color works in the tool → incompatible… So he convert his colors in another more universal format and then he modifies the filter code to integrate this variables 
→ illustrates instrumental genesis… Adapting the external code to his own code system (instrumentalization) anc change his understanding of colors (instrumentation) → also during itw he says he underqtands it better
Describes class of situation in code readability 
(Visual orga, naming, nesting…) e.g SCSS Nesting to mirror html structure 
for efficiency and navigation + understanding their past action : reflexive mediations
Situated : commited to open source culture, easy to understand for other is important… 
Because they assume peers share similar readibility… They can use other ppls code 
Shared "good practices" 
CODE AS A READABLE TRACE OF ACTIVITY → cf. Button & Sharrock on code dvpment : learning to write a program is learning to write in such a way that is intelligeable to a community of practice
Designers are developing resources for future activiy on an individual and collective scale
#### Paged.JS Hackaton
How paged.js users actively shape the tool itself / how community of practice develop their own instruments 
§ interesting to organizing hackaton and using it as a way to be able to observe in a specific time and context (first prson ? julie is part of the members so she had to focus on the hackaton. I wonder how it influences the results : did she "scinder" herself as a part of the community VS researcher ?) 
§ is there already hackatons ? 
Issues and needs rooted in individual past experience (stuff that didnt work in past project) 
§ focus on workaround and breakthrough the same way as we do ahah → reusing past work to make it part of the bigger project is very interesting. I think it's a good thing that it's done within the community instead of "stealing" their work and concepts. 
Sharing stories to reveal common concerns 
§ i'm really interested in how she is part of her own field, the understanding seems much deeper due to that
Local issues reframed as collectiv design challenges (e.g turning individual solutions in generic reusable script modules / creating prototypes around shared pain points like microtypo)  → moving from singular authority to community of practice

### Collective instrumental genesis
= the process of commu of practice elaborating instruments by and for itself
A cycle between individual and collective
1. Disruption of activity/breakdown 
2. Emergence of local instrumental genesis (attempt to respond to the difficulty and individual phase, local and context dependent)
3. Interaction & exchange (collective problematisation) 
4. Collective instruments : development and sharing
5. Local integration, singular use of the collective insturment… which can be adapted again in a singular way
£ co adaptation 
£ simondon / stiegler approach is more philosophy oriented 
£ hci/ergonomics : parallel universes
§ hoigh level for understaidn practices themselves + part of it :) it's very cool to have a broad understanding isnt it ? 
self confrontation to be  higher up and less biased (not easy? )
for hackaton : mainly a catalyser, more than a year of work in two days

§ look at wendy's drawing on types of sciences (positive view in natural sciences… idk what it's about) hci = both interpretative pov and positivist pov.. 
£ the misstruc of man / anthropologists are interpreting with their biases… 

Creating instruments and supporting the instrumentalization (e.g with documentation)

£ michel says if you are your own subject it adds a layer that is both positive and negative … wendy says you should be as objective as possible but being positivitst won't allow you to go deep enough 
£ bottom up / top down depending on the expertise → e.g amélie had just one file while benjamin had a lot . the books were different too : amélie worked for herself, benjamin worked for a client and had to set a cms …
£ wendy speaks of how developers think with variabes/how you can make something general whereas biologists would write scripts that are specific to one object 

Coding and graphic design are both about hierarchy and systems……… cf. end of thesis a discussion about art school/design school not wanting to learn code 
Visual coding part in the thesis (e.g web tools for borders, devtools…) 
post doc is abt where is the wysiwyg in the practices 
figma and code afterwards ; why ? 
paged.js gui project : little tools to see or not see stuff like baseline 
visual informations that u cant see in developper tool
