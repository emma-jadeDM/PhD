# Beyond the Static Sketch: Augmenting Designers' Visual Vocabulary for Teaching and Presentation

sketch as a communcation tool (not ideation tool)

research questions: audience support/author support

## methods

- analysis from design ressources
- itws and collaboration w/ design experts

- formalizing domain knowledghe to design interaction 

goal -> create dynamic/interactive sketch-based communication support

## project: STIVi

in the context of learning how to draw, visual & audio explanations

drawing from limitations to set design goals

related work on turning videos in tutorial are domain specifics, just as STIVi

vocabulary of visual elements and textual descriptors

Hua et al., Developing a Taxonomy for Freehand Sketching in Design (thinking vs talking sketches + sub categories)

£ abt STIVi: who is this sytem for? what abt different needs for students depending on their skills? do u think imposing a step by step tutorial structure may limit creative exploration? would the tool limit personnal style?

-> in industrial design there's already a bit of a style going on... sketches of participants were diff..

£ we can see that ppl have developped specific styles/types of sketching. do u think it's bc they had intrinsinc constraints in their materials? and then we mimic that on a computer, but there are other constraints in computers?
