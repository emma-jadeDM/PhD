# Imposing AI: Deceptive design patterns against sustainability (Annaëlle Beignon)

## Forced adoption of IA through interface design 

At the expense of non-AI feature (highlighting AI feature, spatial stand out through size or position, friction in UX, implementation of automatic AI proprety).

Can't really refuse (delaying, ignore for the moment)

Magnification of AI technicality (stars, purple)

Invisibalization of the materiality of users action (animations hide computation time)

AI narratives: user expects iterative processes/innacurrate results

## Regulation opportunities

- Users are expected to pay the bill of AI investments (making an app harder to use w/o AI) -> Regulating deceptive patterns
- Hard for users to manage digital footprint -> Protecting the capicity of users to moderate digital use/most intensive features shouldn't > least intensive features
- AI act requires environmental reporting from tech companies -> including deceptive design patterns and intensive>less intensive as risk for rebound effect

£ is the push for AI different from other innovations?
-> novel, because it's everywhere and coordinated inbetween most platforms 
£ cloud?

# An Empirical Inquiry into Surveillance Capitalism: Web Tracking (Nils Bonfils, univ of Toronto)

Behavioural data capture

datasets: Ghostery + SEC filings

## Costs of Surveillance Capitalism

### Social

clickbait/attention/privacy

### Environmental

consumerism/processing power/bandwidth usage

Gemini Protocol, Lagrange Gemini Browser

Javascript helping w/ surveillance (cf. mouse tracking)

# Exploring the Viability of the Updated World3 Model for Examining the Impact of Computing on Planetary Boundaries (Nara Guliyeva)

# Sprouting technology otherwise, hospicing negative commons.

In reaction to tech oriented futures

Redirecrting computing toward sustanibility. Proposes a framework drawing on works from other disciplines. 

- Transition studies
- Negative commons (e.g. waste management)
- Commons beyond capitalism 

Digital ruins

- material elements (infrastructure, devices...) likely to persist as negative commons

(e.g. excavation site)

Digital ghosts

- cultural elements that anticipate, justify... formation of alternative futures.... emerge from within a dominant paradigme, often marginalized but...

# ICT Within Limits Requires Old-Fashioned By Design (Olivier Michel, Émilie Frenkiel)

## Context (climate change and consequences)

Environmental crisis. Climate change is only a part of the pb, theu want their framework to be about all platenary boundaries 

Consequence -> zone of uncertainty. fluctuations. 

§ what is fluctuating??


## ICT have no limits but have materiality

ICT are designed w/o limits: unlimited computation/storage/use etc. But they are full of materials (cf. elements in a smartphone, infrastrucutres) which lack recyclability.

ALthough ICT are central in the world/economy they are considered immature within the paper because no limits, have a significant impact (spatial, env, political...) 

ICT was already growing and worrying BEFORE genAI 

§ tension btwn a no limit tech vs the earth's limit notamment

## ICT meets the earth's boundary...and things go wrong

Tension between what we should b doing (big decrease of GHG emissions) VS what is happening (minimal/reasonnable ICT increase)

Even with no growth, we couldn't meet our emission reducing goals!

HOWEVER -> economical issues because big tech are necessary to us economy for ex (or else recession)

## Planetary boundaries and socio-tech systems

What are the consequences ? 
ICT as zombie technologies and negative commons. 

## ICT is in a trap

We need robustess and reduction by building on limits and saving resources.

## saving ressources & simplicity

Limits introduced : time, space, discontinuiuty, computation, ressources, acaibility acceleration, exhaustivity, politics

-> approach of using ressources that are already avaible. 

-> computing with so-called electronic wase (e.g. in their university they already have a lot of it!)

close to the idea of *low-tech*: sustainable and autonomatization BUT no low-tech as it requires electricity. 

cf. Apollo 11 has little RAM compared to iPhone

## An old-fashioned project by design


### technical challenges

unreliable material, heterogenious hardware, variable enery sources, adaptable and autonoimous, keeping the software stack as simple as possible

### sociotechnical level

massive avaibility of weeee, hard to conduct meaningfukll life cyce assessment, change it department practice is hard, avoid reboun effect, change the view point of using "waste" (e.g. calling it a treasure)

# Zombitron: towards a toolbox for repurposing obsolete smartphones into new interactive systems (Clara Rigaud)

Appropriation by creative practiconers/web-based approach 

## Strategies

- Refurbishing? 
- Lighter applications -> customOS, need for skills, time...
- Repurpose as a dedicated role (using them for a specific application) -> issue with heterogenious devices/os
- + smartphones are kept by thei owners and don't get into a circuit of re-purposing

## Creative communities have a practice of re-purposing

- DIY communities (creative/art practices)
- Low/Slow-tech, permacomputing

But : **smartphones are poorly representated in these projects**


## Zombitron

### Principle

New interfaces based on the fact that every smartphone has a browser and wifi antenna -> combining them to create interfaces with a simple web-based approach that won't require expert manipulation

### Prototypes 

Zombitronica 
Zombichord -> only uses the touch screen 

some phones can b used as server or hotspot or client but it rlly depends on the model 

### Integration into musician practices

design opportunities vs device capabilities

using other devices, sensors... more interaction opportunities

exploring combination and performances of obsolete devices

# Practical retrofitting for obsolete devices (Martin Lafréchoux)

## Retrofitting

Replacing a bit of a system with something that is not obsolete/not previously avaible


Obsolete = connectivity as modernity

Idea that modern devices are thought as universal bc of apps, they can always be patched later, they're not autonomous bc supported by huge infrastructures... And they lose functionnality overtime with patches, although it should prolly b the othher way

Idea that older devices are made for a specific use and don't depend on a client, they're autonomous and stable/reliable. More expensive : users expect them to work for a longer time. 

## What we lost in the smartphone

Features : physical buttons/media, offline, autonomous, signal purpose, cool style 

Devices feel obsolete when they lack connectivity and when there is too much friction

Devices are unusable when they have software issues (undocumented, proprietary files format), hardware issues (repairability, impractical medias) and smthg else (couldnt see)

To make an older device useful again u'd have to keep it in working condition, find a way to exchange data and embrace friction

### solutions/leviers

-> euji u should definitely look into that bc u couldnt listen but it's veyr interesting
