U have to think what is the minimum u can get (putting the system in tehir env and they use it if they want....or making them commit to using it ?)
They had designers commit ! They couldve filled papers but they chose interviews to make sure theyd actually use it 
It depends on wether i can integrate the tool in their current workflow or not uwu
