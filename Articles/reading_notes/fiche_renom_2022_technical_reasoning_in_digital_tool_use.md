# Exploring Technical Reasoning in Digital Tool Use (Miguel A. Renom et *al*., 2022)

words: technical reasoning, functionnal fixedness, sensorymotor knowledge, objective knowledge, declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge. 

## The technical reasoning hypothesis

Article assessed the relevance of TR (from cognitive/neuro science) in the context of digital tool use. 

TR = tool use as a mix of mechanical knowledge (knowledge of mechanical principles, e.g. "sharp can cut") and object-based knowledge (knowledge of the propreties of an object, e.g. this blade is sharp)

-> These are abstract knowledge. There's no need to understand them/be able to put them into language. It's not objective but rather acquired through one's experience within the physical world. 

-> It can help solve problem, e.g. it can be applied to multiple contexts (sharp knife cuts, but so could a sharp piece of glass). Thus, TR allows human to replace a tool by another suitable tool.

HCI litterature suggests that this could work in digital env (cf. MBL Instruments for Interaction + studies showing that users repurpose tools in unexpected ways) BUT digital environments only offer a limited set of objects to interact with. For instance, photoshop's eraser works on pixels but not on vectors. It hinders repurposing tools. 

TR challenges "sensorymotor knowledge" (Osiurak & Badels) because it does not consider that humans associate physical action w/ the physical proprety of (or visual stimuli provided by) an object but rather that tool use resided in human's interaction with their tools. It suggests that itis possible for humans to develop "unusual use" of objects thanks to TR (e.g. using a fork's handle to eat yogurt).

### Digital Tool Use

**HCI widly studies and theorizes tools as mediators between users and their environment but the litterature lacks a cognitive perspective.**

- Bodker : tools as mediating means between users and target objects / digital tools as artifacts mediating our activity within computers
- Béguin & Rabardel : *instrumental genesis*, Instrumentation VS Instrumentalization
- MBL instrumental interaction : digital instruments mediate user interactions with domain objects

**Perceptual similarities between physical and digital tool use are studies too but still not from a cognitive pov**

- Bérard & Rochet Capellan : sensorimotor similarity between physical & digital interaction 
- Bergström : tool extension
- Signley & Anderson : transfer knowledge between different shortcuts for a same tool, supposedly partly thanks to delcarative knowledge 

### Re-purposing Digital Tools

**Litterature shows evidence of tool re-purposing strategies/unexpected use of digital tools.** Not systematically studies yet, we don't understand how users come up with unexpected uses.

### Factors in Tool Re-purposing 

**The more experience a user has with their tool, the more time they spent using it, the more skilled they become. As experts, it can be easier to re-purpose tools because of good declarative/procedural knowledge. However, humans experience *functional fixedness* and associate functions with objects, making it harder to imagine new uses of a tool.**

- Fitts & Posner : motor skill goes from conscious to non conscious cognitive effort
- Anderson : declarative VS procedural knowledge, all declarative knowledge can become procedural BUT if users are only based on procedural knowledge it'd be harder to find alternative ways to do things/develop new uses for softwares
- Activity theory : actions (conscious) =/= operations (subconscious) -> actions become operations through practice, operations can become actions when a problem occurs

**Re-purposing can be a creative solution to a tool based problem, we can expect creative individuals to practice tool re-purposing -> suggesting that experience might *not* be a requirement for tool re-purposing.**

## STUDY: Command re-purposing in text editing

§ I'm not writing about the study in itself but rather conclusions/what i learned. 

Quantitative (tools used, by whom, what order, etc) and qualitative (thematic analysis)

### Results

Correlation between increase in difficulty (i think it means when a tool isn't made for a specific use) and number of commands to find a solution. 

Creativity seems to be the only significant predictor of re-purposing tendencies (experience is less representative).
§ ig we could excpect this from designers 

#### Experience can be a bias

Users based their first actions on common practices, perhaps because they recognize the environment.

**Personnal experience induce biases (looking for a specific tool) and blocks (not knowing what to do when they can't find it).**     

- Blocks generate frustration.
- Users had a sense of what *should* and *shouldn't* be done, based on their use of familliar tools.

**Users use their kowledge of other text editing softwares.**

- They think of how/what they usually do, or even what they know exists even if they're no master of it.
- They associate tasks to commands and try to think of procedures to tackles task.

**Some users judge techniques based of their knowledge of good practices.**

- They think there are "bad approached" which can make them reluctant to re-purpose through "bad practice", even if it can be effective.

#### Participants use TR

**They knew text mechanics and could describe a cmd's effect or even partly understand how could re-purposing help them even if they didn't realize the full potential of their idea.**

**Some transfered from past experiences happened.**

- e.g. using shaped of the bg's color to create space in a drawing tools VS coloring the text in the bg's color to create space.

**They consciously AND aimlessly tried commands in the environment.**

- Random trial and error when lacking new ideas (might be biased by the experience's design but shows they know text editing evironnment can have hidden features and/or allow undo)

### There is **evidence of TR** and **evidence of functionnal fixedness**.

- **Principled expectations** because of their understanding of text mechanics (abstract knowledge, not always able to explain)
- **Re-purposing** of at least one command. Association with past practice = they might find analogies with other digital environments (**transfer**). 
- Makes sense that there's **more re-purposing** when ppl are **more creative** (with litterature) 
- Random trials as **fidgeting/fiddling behaviours** in physical spaces associated w/ **creative processes**.
- User focus more on completing tasks than exploring the environment/look for strategies ("production bias")
- **Functionnal fixedness** resonating with 'mental set' in problem-solving (using a known pattern in a non suitable context)

### HCI 

The article suggest that it'd be relevant to design instruments/tools to interact with an object's proprety instead of trying to multiplying the objects they can interact with.
