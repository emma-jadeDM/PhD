# This is Not a Boundary Object: Reflections on the Origin of a Concept (Leigh Star, 2010)

## Defining *boundary object*

- Boundary as a *shared space* confouding here and there
- Object in its computer science, its pragmatist and its material sense. Something people (or other objects and programs) act towards and with -> sense of action, not just of "thing" / a theory can be an object
- Temporal, based in action, subject to reflection, to local tailoring & distributed throughout all of these dimensions (*n-dimensional*)

Three aspects:
- **Interpretive flexibility**
    - objects ressembling each other, overlapping, could be indistringuishable... But different use and interpretation of the object
    - cf. A map: one place could be interpreted as a place of rest or as a data collecting point.
- **Material/organizational structure**
    - Objects forming boundaries between different groups (organized around work and/or play) through flexibility and shared structure
- **Scale/granularity**

Four possible forms (non-exhaustive):
- **Repository** (set of modular things that can be individually removed without collapsing/changing the structure as a whole)
    - e.g. a library, a collection of case studies
    - bc need to assemble things conceived iteratively. internal heterogeneity can happen (not confrontational)
    - heuristic advantage: encapsulation of internal units
    - iterative work process preserving particulars. well suited for private investigations (alone or in groups)

> others forms are in the intial publication

Initial concept: analyze the nature of cooperative work in the absence of consensus (instead of thinking that first consensus must be achieved and *then* we can cooperate)

The **object**:
- is a set of material and processual work arrangements
- resides between social worlds/communities of practices
- is worked on by local groups -> they maintain a vague identity of it as a common onbject + make it more specific/tailor it to their local use within their social world -> object is useful for work that is **not** interdisciplinary
- is worked on by groups cooperating w/o consensus and tacking back-and-forth between both forms of the object 

-> idea that if the back-and-forth stops/scales up/becomes standardized: the boundary object becomes infrastructure, standard (e.g. methodological) or other processes etc. 

The thing is: the concept as been appropriated. a lot of things can be a BO, thus the author has been asked: what is *not* a boundary object? 

## Origins of BO 

From multiple studies w/ students, focusing on "special language" and things that strike them as "strange". The conclusions are:

Local tailoring is a form of work that is invisible. Shared representation can be vague and useful. 
(e.g. going from messy lab notes to structured reports; there's work going in the making of a structured report yet you'll miss some of the information such as stains on your lab notes)

Collecting, disciplining and coordinating distributed knowledge can be a problem when people are using a different language or adopting different povs. 
(e.g. patients have a more intern pov on their sickness than doctors, their insights are different)

Standards and boundary objects are related, especially over time. Standards can't take all margins in account.
(e.g. writing in the margins of a form and then the person using the form after will only take in account what fits the fields)

BO can take unperfect forms and be used to communicate something accross different groups (e.g. the map of a monkey's brain is different from a human but can be used as an exemple when talking to amateurs). It has mediational qualities and can sit in the middle of different groups, be ill-structure and sketchy... While also being adjustable to the needs of a group (e.g. biology experts adjusting the brain map to their specific and detailed use)

There are things that can't fit into categories/standards. There are intercategorical objects, residual categories, "others" than can be a problem. (e.g. a non indentified bird is not part of the bird category because not standardized and thus, although it carries meaning, won't be used in the research field)

There are communication tangles happening when people use expert/alien language to answer questions. (e.g. users asks questions to a dev, dev answers in alien terms, users is not more informed and thus struggle putting the system in a work infrastructure)


### Propreties of infrastructure

- **Embeddedness**
- **Transparency**
- **Reach/scope**
- **Learned as part of a membership**
- **Links with conventions of practice**
- **Embodimment of standards**
- **Built on an installed base**
- **Becomes visible upon breakdown**
- **Is fixed in modular increments**
- ****

## What is **not** a boundary object? 

### Scale

Anything in terms of object could be a boundary object but it depends on the scale. According to the article, an object is interesting as a BO if it's seen on a organizational level. Being ambiguous is not enough. Thus, it's not even that the object has a wide scale but specifically the nature of the work relationships organized around the object. Meaning that a word being debated by many people on the rosetta stone could be a BO but not just any word if there's no study or "debate" around it.

### Scope

Once again, it's about work arragement around an object and how interpretative flexibility is not enough of a criteria. E.g. American flags have interpretative flexibility but what makes them a BO would be the different work arrangements around it (selling, making, advertising...)

## Growth and death of the BO

There's a cycle going on :

↱ BOUNDARY OBJECTS → STANDARDIZATION → RESIDUAL CATEGORIES
RESIDUAL CATEGORIES ← STANDARDIZATION ← BOUNDARY OBJECTS ↵

In terms of methods we could make objects out of that (e.g. standardization or residual categories), dwell w/ the inhabitants or objects of the residual spaces and further develop an analystic framework for understanding **information**, **lived experience** and **infrastructure**.

§ to me it's about how we can't standardize everything because people can and will developp other practices, margins, etc and thus create more BO as they try to fit their needs? 

Standardization can be as usefull (calculations of global warming) as hurtful (electronic surveillance)
