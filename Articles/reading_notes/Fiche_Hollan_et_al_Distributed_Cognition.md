# Distributed cognition: toward a new foundation for human-computer interaction research (Hollan et *al*., 2000)

## Introduction

Considering a rise in computation (and complex tasks, networked interaction and digital information), cognitive distribution focus on environment to understand people. It presents a human-centered focus on cognition, considering people and their interactions with ressources and materials which are happening in their environment. 
Cognitive distribution pushes the boundaries of cognition processes from the individual/what is in their head (traditionnal way) to sociotechnical systems. It considers elements withing a cognitive process through their functional relationships rather than their place in space. It holds physical environment as capabel of holding memory. 

Systems are capable of configuring themselves to allow coordination within sub-systems. It sees cognitive processes as able to :
- Be **distributed among people of a group**
- Involve **coordination with internal and external structure** (material or environmental)
- Be **distributed in time** in such a way that older events can transform the nature of later events. 

## A distributed cognition approach

### Socially Distributed Cognition 

The work is based on a rise of studies about socially distributed cognition. Social organization (as well as an activity's context) shape the way information flows within a group. (Implying that cognition is also distributed in an individual, as if the brain was a larger society itself).

Cognition processes are distributed in groups. They include phenomena of social interactions AND interaction between people and the structures in their environment.

### Embodied cognition

The body causes a relation with one's immediate environment (≠ minds only creating internal models of the external world). 

Embodied cognition considers the relationship (coordination) between internal and external process -> between memory/attention/executive fonction and objects/artifacts/at hand materials.

It considers an embodies cognitive system : the body in relation with the material world -> the material world is thus part of the cognitive system. E. g. : visually impaired person + their can as part of their perception of the world.

### Culture and Cognition

1. Culture emerges from human activity.
    - As mental, material and social structures
2. Culture shapes cognitive processes. 
    - Of a system inside which an individual operates (not just an individual's processes), esp. when the system is made of agents/artifacts/environments. 

Culture is a reservoir of ressources for learning, problem solving and reasonning. It accumulates partial solutions from past experiences of frequent problems. -> One can build on the success of others as cultures provides intellectual tools. There's no need to start from scratch. The downside is that culture may hinder the finding of novel ways of thinking. 

### Ethnography of Distributed Cognitive Systems

The article suggests that a new kind of cognitive ethnography is necessar. In the 60's/70's, it focused on meaning systems in the context of individual minds. DC ethnography would focus on both the individual mind andd the material/social means of the construction of action and meaning.
-> An event-focused ethnography of what people know + how they use what they know to do what they do. (= how the mind processes information AND how the information is processed in a social/material world, e.g. though the lense technical expertise)

§ DC ethnography appears to me (EJ) as a set of methods closely tied with how we work at ExSitu : committing to a field to have a deep understanding of the practices (how artifacts are interacted with) to better support practices. + multi-mocal studies (interviews, observations, participation in training programs, studying artifacts and manuals...)

What matters is to **identify the critical features of an interaction**. 

## An integrated framework for research

The framework is constitued of 5 elements (DC, Ethnography, Experiment, Work Materials & Workplaces) that are part of 4 principles.
1. people establish and coordinate different types of structures in their environment
2. it takes effort to maintain coordination 
3. people off-load cognitive effort to the environment whenever practical
4. there are improved dynamics of cognitive load-balancing avaible in social organization

The principles (from cognition study) inform both ethnography (observation) and experiments. Indeed, real-world observations are so rich that they can be limited. Experiments are based on observation through testing specific aspects of an observed behaviour. Thus, they help refine our theories which can help refine our designs. Finally, design can reveal new behaviours to study -> that's the **cycle of activity**.

↱ OBSERVATION → THEORY → DESIGN 
DESIGN ← THEORY ← OBSERVATION ↵

Ethnography  offers new design perspectives suchs as :
- New uses found for old strategies
- Transfer of effective technique from a setting to an other

### Serie of exemples in different parts

The article takes a few different studies to show relevant exemple of the methods. I only wrote about what I found interesting. 

#### Airline Cockpit Automation

Better understanding -> better design
Preserving a core feature/proprety of interaction and pushing it further 

#### Beyond Direct Manipulation 

Direct manipulation is the idead that the representation is (cognitively) what it is (an icon) and what it represents (a file, a folder...)
However one can find a gap when physical objects are represented because moving them on the screen isn't moving them physically. 

Idea that a user's familiarity with an environment helps them situate themselves deeplier in it. Having better representation and understanding. The article defends the idea that interaction design could go beyond copying real workd and instead exploid opportunities of the computational world. 

#### History-Enriched Digital Objects

IRL, objects can hold history of one's interaction with them (worn object, book kept open, piece of paper at the top of a pile). This history is oftentimes designed out of "clean" and "simple" environments despite being essential to some cognition processes. 
-> Suggests encoding informations about history of use in digital projects and being able to display them graphically (e.g. seeing older versions of a source code to know where we are coming from while debugging)

#### PAD ++: Zoomable Multiscale Interfaces

People alone adapt through interaction (e.g. approaching one's eyes towards an object) and scaffolding (temporary structures, e.g. magnifying glass to see something from closer). Collectively, people adapt through culture (e.g. history of information) and intelligent coordination.

Considering interface elements as part of one's thinking process can help linking interfaces with cognition. E.g. leaving a WIP open to go back to it later. 
-> People reorganize their workplace constantly.
-> **Space is a ressource** in the same manner as time, energy, memory. 

Spatial arrangements can help:
- Simplifying choice
    - e.g. aligning items in the a set order that mimick task orders, to off-load memory
- Facillitating perception
    - e.g. grouping similar jigsaw pieces together, putting small mechanical parts on a piece of paper to see them together
- Limiting internal computation 
    - e.g. when using tetris, having the game rotate the geometrical shapes = modifying the world to avoid the costly and error-prone computation of rotating them in your head
